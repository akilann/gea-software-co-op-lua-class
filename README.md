# GEA Software Co-op Lua Class

This repo contains all learning material from the Summer 2018 GEA Software Co-op class conducted by [@Abar23](https://github.com/Abar23) and [@akilan98](https://github.com/akilan98). All class files begin with a number, followed by an underscore (`_`), followed by the topic name (i.e. `1_Types.lua`)

All files can be run using the command:

`lua X_Topic.lua`

where `X_Topic.lua` is the file (i.e. `1_Types.lua`).
