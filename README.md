# GEA_Co-op_Lua_Class

All files are fully runnable (after the `inspect` LuaRock is installed).

## Inspect
In order to run the files with `inspect`, the `inspect` LuaRock needs to be installed. To install simply run:

`luarocks install inspect`
  
LuaRocks must be installed (should be installed if Lua is installed with `lenv` or you are on a GEA Mac).
